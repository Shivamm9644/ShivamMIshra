This repository contains solutions to a variety of beginner-to-intermediate level Java problems. Each Java file demonstrates a focused use case, such as arithmetic operations, odd number sequences, and array divisibility checks.

###  Problem1 - Basic Calculator
A simple calculator program that accepts two numbers and an operation (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, or `divide`) from the user, and returns the result.

- **Input**: Two double values and an operation string
- **Output**: Result of the operation
- **Edge Case**: Handles divide-by-zero using `ArithmeticException`


###  Problem2 - First N Odd Numbers
Generates the first `N` odd numbers and prints them as a comma-separated list.

- **Input**: An integer `N` from the user
- **Output**: Sequence like `1,3,5,...`


### 🔁 Problem3 - First N Odd Numbers (Handling Even Inputs)
Similar to Problem2, but ensures that the sequence length is always odd, adjusting the input accordingly.

- **Input**: Integer `N`
- **Logic**: If `N` is even, it subtracts 1 to make the output an odd-length sequence
- **Output**: Comma-separated odd numbers



###  Problem4 - Divisibility Count
Counts how many elements in an integer array are divisible by numbers from 1 to 9.

- **Array**: `{1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30}`
- **Output**: Print how many elements are divisible by each number from 1 to 9
